# MTRN4010
A Control system course assignment to compute position and pose vectors as a function of IMU data, and to additionally apply an extended Kalman filter using depth data from a camera and reference walls of a drone like flying platform.

Data was provided in .mat form, with IMU data, Image and depth map. As the datasets are large spanning a long time of flight they are not included in this repo.
